Basic memory game where the user/s are able to select the amount of players, then try to match tiles in order to get points

Game starts by selecting the amount of players and entering their names.
Users are then able to select the size of the grid they would like to play on 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 etc.

Grid is created with all tiles face down.
Player 1 will select 2 tiles. If the picture revealed on the other side of the tile matches, Player 1 is awarded 1 point and selects another set of tiles (gets another turn).
If Player 1 selects tiles that do not match, the tiles revert to the face down position and the next player has a turn.
This continues until all tiles are matched and the player with the most points wins.
